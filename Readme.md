This repository implements a comprehensive **Retail Analytics pipeline** that spans the full lifecycle of data science in retail — from raw data to actionable insights and deployment.

It combines:

 1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering

 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 3. Store and department segmentation

 4. Market basket analysis

 5. Anomaly detection

 6. Sales forecasting (short- and long-term)

 7. Streamlit app for interactive forecasting and analysis

**Problem Statement**

Retailers face three major challenges:

**1. Demand forecasting:** Predicting store-level weekly sales with high accuracy.

**2. Behavioral segmentation:** Understanding performance variation across stores and departments.

**3. Cross-sell discovery:** Identifying co-purchased product categories to improve promotions.

This project provides a unified analytics workflow to address all three using statistical and machine learning approaches.

**Data Flow & Methodology**

**1. Data Preprocessing:**

Merge sales, store, and feature datasets.

Handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies.

Create lag and rolling-window features for temporal modeling.

Generate holiday and event-based dummy variables.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Analyze sales trends and seasonality by store and department.

Visualize macroeconomic effects (CPI, fuel price, unemployment).

Identify high-growth vs stagnant departments.

**3. Segmentation:**

Used Silhouette and Elbow methods for optimal cluster selection.
![Silhouette score and number of clusters](results/Elbow%20method%20and%20silhouette%20score%20for%20number%20of%20clusters.png)
Store and Dept segmentation via K-Means and Agglomerative.
![Store Clustering](results/Clustering%20using%20various%20methods.png)


**4. Market Basket Analysis**

Implemented Apriori algorithm to find association rules.

Used metrics: support, confidence, and lift.

Focused on top 10 rules with high lift for actionable insights.
