**Problem Statement**

Retailers face three major challenges:

**1. Demand forecasting:** Predicting store-level weekly sales with high accuracy.

**2. Behavioral segmentation:** Understanding performance variation across stores and departments.

**3. Cross-sell discovery:** Identifying co-purchased product categories to improve promotions.

This project provides a unified analytics workflow to address all three using statistical and machine learning approaches.

**Data Flow & Methodology**

**1. Data Preprocessing:**

Merge sales, store, and feature datasets.

Handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies.

Create lag and rolling-window features for temporal modeling.

Generate holiday and event-based dummy variables.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Analyze sales trends and seasonality by store and department.

Visualize macroeconomic effects (CPI, fuel price, unemployment).

Identify high-growth vs stagnant departments.

**3. Segmentation:**

Used Silhouette and Elbow methods for optimal cluster selection.
![Silhouette score and number of clusters](results/Elbow%20method%20and%20silhouette%20score%20for%20number%20of%20clusters.png)
Store and Dept segmentation via K-Means and Agglomerative.
![Store Clustering](results/Clustering%20using%20various%20methods.png)
🧭 Segmentation Insights

Cluster 0 (Large & Volatile Stores)

- High median sales but strong seasonality and higher volatility (4–6% anomalies).

- Weak markdown correlation → promotions have limited impact.

- Lower sales per store size → under-utilized space.
   Key Actions:
- Focus forecasting on seasonal peaks, cut blanket discounts, and optimize product mix for better space efficiency.

Cluster 1 (Small & Stable Stores)

- Lower sales but highly stable, predictable demand.

- Stronger markdown correlation → promotions work well here.

- Higher sales per size → efficient space use.
 Key Actions:
Use targeted markdowns, maintain lean inventory, and explore expansion or pilot launches in these efficient stores.

**4. Market Basket Analysis**

Implemented Apriori algorithm to find association rules.

Used metrics: support, confidence, and lift.
![Support vs Confidence](results/Support%20vs%20Confidence.png)  
Most rules cluster at high confidence (>0.9) and moderate support (0.3–0.6), meaning several product pairs are reliably co-purchased, though not necessarily across all transactions.
 Business Implication:
Focus cross-sell efforts on these high-confidence, mid-support rules — they represent consistent but not over-saturated co-purchases (ideal for bundle promotions).


Focused on top 10 rules with high lift for actionable insights.
### Top 10 Association Rules (by Lift)
| Rank | Antecedents | Consequents | Support | Confidence | Lift |
|------|--------------|-------------|----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | 37 | 96, 58 | 0.3128 | 0.7814 | **1.7310** |
| 2 | 37 | 49, 58 | 0.3680 | 0.9193 | **1.6044** |
| 3 | 37 | 96, 49 | 0.3215 | 0.8032 | **1.5392** |
| 4 | 37 | 49, 54 | 0.3503 | 0.8750 | **1.5313** |
| 5 | 37 | 58, 94 | 0.3618 | 0.9037 | **1.5200** |
| 6 | 37 | 49, 94 | 0.3767 | 0.9410 | **1.5157** |
| 7 | 37 | 80, 49 | 0.3880 | 0.9693 | **1.5136** |
| 8 | 37 | 96, 54 | 0.3038 | 0.7589 | **1.5134** |
| 9 | 37 | 49, 98 | 0.3818 | 0.9538 | **1.4854** |
| 10 | 37 | 49, 93 | 0.3890 | 0.9717 | **1.4831** |

| Observation                                 | Business Interpretation                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High lift (1.73) for {37 → 96, 58}          | Strong **triplet dependency** — indicates frequent joint purchase patterns, suitable for *bundle-based discounts*.                     |
| Repeated appearance of {37, 49, 58, 94, 96} | Suggests a **core product ecosystem** — optimizing shelf placement or recommendation engine around these can drive basket size.        |
| Confidence >0.9 in most rules               | Customers show **habitual pairing** behavior, ideal for loyalty and repeat-purchase marketing.                                         |
| Moderate support (~0.35)                    | These combinations aren’t universal, so **target promotions selectively** to stores or segments where these co-purchases are frequent. |


![Network Plot](results/Network%20plot.png)  
Insight:
Department 37 acts as a central hub, frequently co-occurring with 49, 58, 94, and 96 — these edges also have the highest lift.
Business Implication:
- Create bundled offers around Department 37 items (it triggers multiple complementary purchases).
- Position these departments adjacently in stores or cross-promote online (e.g., “Customers buying from Dept 37 also purchase from 49 and 58”).


Product category 37 is the anchor department for cross-selling opportunities. Most high-lift combinations involve 49, 58, 94, and 96, making them strong candidates for co-marketing, joint offers, and adjacency planning.
These insights directly guide planogram optimization, personalized recommendations, and campaign targeting.

**5. Anomaly Detection**

Using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor
![Isolation Forest and LOF](results/anomaly_detection_IF_LOF.png)

Red points indicate anomalous sales weeks flagged by Isolation Forest (top) and Local Outlier Factor (bottom).
LOF is better at detecting local outliers compared to Isolation Forest

Decomposed sales series using STL.
![STL Decomposition](results/STL%20Decomposition%20along%20with%20rolling%20anomalies%20of%20Store%2040%2C%20Dept%2060.png)
The top panel decomposes weekly sales into trend, seasonality, and residuals.
The bottom panel overlays detected anomalies (red = statistical outliers, green = rolling-window anomalies).
Spikes in residuals coincide with red markers, confirming the model’s sensitivity to sharp, non-seasonal fluctuations.
  
**6.Forecasting**

Models: LightGBM, XGBoost, Prophet, and hybrid ensembles.

| Metric | Value |
|---------|--------|
| RMSE | 4779.57 |
| R² | 0.9526 |
| Median RMSE (across stores) | ~4800 |


![Global(Chain level) XGBoost Forecast](results/xgboost_predictions.png)

- LightGBM and XGBoost outperform Prophet for long-term horizons.
